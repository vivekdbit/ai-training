A growing number of high schools\\noffer some introduction to philosophy, often in special literature\\ncourses for college bound students. In Europe and many other\\ncountries, it is much more common to find philosophy in the high\\nschool curriculum. However, philosophy prior to high school seems\\nrelatively uncommon around the world. This may suggest that serious\\nphilosophical thinking is not for pre-adolescents. At least three\\nreasons might be offered for accepting this view. First, philosophical\\nthinking requires a level of cognitive development that, one may\\nbelieve, is beyond the reach of most pre-adolescents. Second,\\nespecially in the United States, the school curriculum is already\\ncrowded; and introducing a subject like philosophy, it may be thought,\\nwill distract students from what they need to learn. Third, given that\\nphilosophical inquiry raises questions that more often than not resist\\ndefinitive answers, it may encourage students to become skeptics\\nrather than learners. However, as shall be seen, these reasons can be\\nchallenged.  \\nEntry Contents \\n \\n Entry Contents  \\n1. Can Children Philosophize?  \\n2. Philosophy in a Crowded Curriculum  \\n3.

Philosophy For Children Today  \\nBibliography  \\nBooks and Articles  \\nPeriodicals  \\nAcademic Tools  \\nOther Internet Resources  \\nRelated Entries  \\n1. Can Children Philosophize?  \\nJean Piaget’s (1933) well-known theory of cognitive development\\nsuggests that prior to age 11 or 12, most children are not capable of\\nphilosophical thinking. This is because, it holds, prior to this time,\\nchildren are not capable of “thinking about thinking,” the\\nsort of meta-level thinking that philosophical thinking requires. This\\nlevel of cognitive development includes analogical reasoning about\\nrelationships, such as: “Bicycle is to handlebars as ship is to\\nrudder, with ‘steering mechanism’ being the similar\\nrelationship” (Goswami, p. xxi). However, there is a solid body\\nof psychological research that indicates Piaget’s account\\nseriously underestimates children’s cognitive abilities\\n(Astington, 1993; Gopnik, et al., 1999; Gopnik, 2009).  \\nPhilosopher Gareth Matthews went further and argued at length that\\nPiaget failed to see the philosophical thinking manifest in the very\\nchildren he studied. In  ,\\nMatthews (1980) provides a number of delightful illustrations of very\\nyoung children’s philosophical puzzlement. For example:  \\nPhilosophy and the Young Child  \\nTIM (about six years), while busily engaged in licking a pot,\\nasked, “Papa, how can we be sure that everything is not a\\ndream?” (p. 1)  \\nJORDAN (five years), going to bed at eight one evening, asked,\\n“If I go to bed at eight and get up at seven in the morning, how\\ndo I really know that the little hand of the clock has gone around\\nonly once? Do I have to stay up all night to watch it? If I look away\\neven for a short time, maybe the small hand will go around\\ntwice.” (p. 3)  \\nOne day JOHN EDGAR (four years), who had seen airplanes take off,\\nrise, and gradually disappear into the distance, took his first plane\\nride. When the plane stopped ascending and the seat-belt sign went\\nout, John Edgar turned to his father and said in a rather relieved,\\nbut still puzzled, tone of voice, “Things don’t really get\\nsmaller up here.” (p. 4)  \\nHowever, it might be objected, commonly observable as they might be,\\nmore than such anecdotes are needed to show that children are capable\\nof serious philosophical thinking. What is needed is evidence that\\nchildren are capable of   philosophical discussion.\\nMatthews (1984) provides illustrations of this, too. For example,\\nmeeting with a group of 8–11 year olds, he used the following\\nexample to develop a story for discussion:  \\nsustained  \\nIan (six years old) found to his chagrin that the three children of\\nhis parents’ friends monopolized the television; they kept him\\nfrom watching his favorite program. “Mother,” he asked in\\nfrustration, “why is it better for three children to be selfish\\nthan one?” (Matthews 1984, 92–3)  \\nThis generated a lively discussion in which children commented on the\\ninconsiderateness of the three visiting children, the desirability of\\nworking out a solution that would satisfy all four children, the\\nimportance of respecting people’s rights, and how one might feel\\nif he or she were in Ian’s place. Matthews then posed a possible\\nutilitarian approach: “What about this argument, that if we let\\nthe three visitors have their way, three people will be made happy\\ninstead of just one?” One reply was that it would not be fair\\nfor three people to get what they want at the expense of a fourth.\\nThis triggered a discussion of fairness that addressed more specific\\nconcerns about the relative ages of the children, whether they are\\nfriends, siblings, or strangers—and what types of television\\nprograms are involved.  \\nNo doubt, part of the explanation of the children’s ability and\\nwillingness to carry on an extended discussion of Ian’s\\ncircumstance is that they have faced similar challenges. Still, they\\nexhibited a rather sophisticated grasp of the conceptual and moral\\nissues at hand, which is what one might expect from children once they\\nare invited to reflect on their own experiences.  \\nStories about children roughly one’s own age can provide\\nopportunities to discuss ideas that are most important to a child.\\nConsider this example from Matthew Lipman’s novel  \\n(1983). Harry and his friend Timmy go to a stamp club to trade stamps.\\nAfterward they stop for ice cream cones, but Timmy discovers he has no\\nmoney. Harry offers to buy him one, and Timmy says he will buy Harry a\\ncone next time. As they are leaving the store, one of their classmates\\ntrips Timmy. Timmy then knocks the tripper’s books off the\\ntable. After running away from the scene, Timmy and Harry talk about\\nwhat has happened:  \\nLisa  \\n“I couldn’t let them get away with it,” Timmy\\nremarked when they saw that they weren’t being pursued and could\\nslow down to a walk. “He didn’t have to stick his foot\\nout.” Then he added, “Of course, I didn’t have to do\\nwhat I did either. But, like I said before, turnabout is fair\\nplay.”  \\n“Somehow,” Harry thought, “it isn’t quite the\\nsame thing.” But he couldn’t figure out why. “I\\ndon’t know,” he said finally to Timmy. “The purpose\\nof your stamp club is to exchange stamps. So when you give someone\\nstamps, you’re supposed to give something back. Just like if\\nsomeone lends me money, I’m supposed to give it back. But if\\nsomeone pulls a dirty trick on you, should you do the same thing to\\nhim? I’m not so sure.”  \\n“But I had to get even,” Timmy protested. “I\\ncouldn’t let him get away with it, tripping me like that for no\\nreason.”  \\nA bit later they met Lisa and Laura. Harry told the girls what had\\nhappened and why he was puzzled. “It reminds me,” remarked\\nLisa, “of last year when we were learning about how some\\nsentences could be turned around and would stay true, while others,\\nwhen you turned them around, would become false.”  \\n“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “but there we found a rule.\\nWhat’s the rule here?” Lisa tossed her long hair so that\\nit hung over her right shoulder. “It looks like there are times\\nwhen it is right to give back what we got and other times when it is\\nwrong. But how do we tell which is which?” ( , pp.\\n23–4)  \\nLisa  \\nThis passage is an invitation to explore the moral nuances of\\nreciprocity, or “returning in kind.” What might a group of\\n10–11 year-olds have to say about this? Here is a sampling from\\na lengthy discussion of the   passage by a group of fifth\\ngraders (Pritchard 1996). With very little prompting from the teacher,\\nthe students raised and vigorously pursued questions such as the\\nfollowing:  \\nLisa  \\nWhat is likely to happen when we retaliate? Will this simply start\\na long chain of trying to “get things even” that no one\\n(other than perhaps the initiator) wants?  \\nCan retaliating really “get things even”? Can we even\\nmake sense of “getting things even”?  \\nIs it really right to respond to a wrong by returning in kind? Is\\nthis trying to make a right out of two wrongs?  \\nWhat alternatives to trying to “get things even” might\\nthere be? What would happen if you just ignore someone who is trying\\nto get a rise out of you?  \\nWhen is self-defense the best strategy?  \\nIs there a difference between trying to “get things\\neven” and trying to “teach someone a lesson”?  \\nCan something like the Golden Rule help us here? What does the\\nGolden Rule  ? Is it a   rule?  \\nmean  \\ngood  \\nThoughtful and insightful questions like this are not unusual for\\nchildren when they are given the opportunity to express them.\\nThis discussion was prompted by a children’s novel. However,\\nstudents’ regular classroom materials, works of art, thought\\nexperiments, the daily news, or their own experiences can trigger\\nphilosophical discussions of moral concepts and concerns.  \\nEven if one concedes that children are quite capable of engaging in\\nextended discussions of   concepts related to their own\\nexperiences, what about philosophical ideas that are less immediately\\nrelated to their practical affairs? Here is an illustration that\\nbegins with logic and ends up in metaphysics.  \\nmoral  \\nThe true sentence, “All oaks are trees” becomes false when\\nreversed. So does, “All carrots are vegetables.” Can we\\nsay that   true sentence beginning with ‘all’\\nbecomes false when reversed? The children in   initially are tempted to say, yes.\\nBut at least as early as the 3  grade, children easily\\nfind exceptions. What about “All tigers are tigers”, many\\nwill ask. Others may respond that this is an uninteresting sentence,\\noffering something like “All rabbits are hares,” or\\n“All mothers have children” as alternatives. With\\nrelatively little encouragement, they can come up with good\\ndefinitions of geometric figures and differentiate them from proposed\\ndefinitions that cannot be reversed. For example, “All squares\\nare rectangles” is true, but it becomes false when reversed.\\n“All squares are rectangles with equal sides,” however,\\ncan be reversed.  \\nevery  \\nHarry\\nStottlemeier’s Discovery  \\nrd  \\nAlthough the study of logic is traditionally regarded as a part of\\nphilosophy, critics might not find the reflections of children on such\\nrules of logic terribly interesting philosophically. (Of course, some\\nmight say this about elementary logic in the college classroom, as\\nwell.) It is not that different from basic math and grammar, they\\nmight object. Whether or not this is a fair assessment, for many\\nchildren it is but a short step from logic to metaphysics. Here is an\\nexample from a 4  grade class that had just been asked\\nwhether true sentences beginning with ‘all’ always become\\nfalse when reversed (Pritchard 1996). After the usual “All\\ntigers are tigers” and “All rabbits are hares” were\\nsuggested, a student asked, “How about ‘All answers have\\nquestions’ and ‘All questions have answers’?”\\nFortunately, the teacher paused to explore this with the class,\\nasking“Do all answers have questions?” Of course, replied\\nthe students, otherwise we would not say that we have an\\n .  \\nth  \\nanswer  \\nThe teacher continued, “How about the other sentence? Do you\\nthink that all questions have answers?” What followed was a\\nflood of responses:  \\nStudent #1: “Is there life in the center of the\\nsun?”  \\nStudent #2: “Even though we can’t go there to find\\nout, the question still has an answer.”  \\nStudent #3: “How many grains of sand are there on\\nearth?”  \\nStudent #4: “There’s a definite number even though we\\ndon’t know what it is.”  \\nStudent #3: “The wind will blow them all around, and\\nwe’ll count some more than once.”  \\nStudent #5: “There are too many to count.”  \\nStudent #6: “How many grains of sand are there on all the\\nplanets?”  \\nStudent #7: “How many trees are there on earth?”  \\nStudent #4: “That’s easier than grains of sand. We\\ncould count the trees.”  \\nStudent #7: “By the time you finish counting them, some\\nwould have fallen down and others would have started to\\ngrow.”  \\nStudent #8: “Did God make time begin?”  \\nStudent #9: “You mean,   there is a God, did he\\nmake time begin?”  \\nif  \\nStudent #7: “Does space have limits?”  \\nStudent #5: “Yeah, what would happen if you got to the end\\nof space and tried to put your hand out? If you couldn’t, what\\nwould be holding it back on the outside?”  \\nStudent #6: “Maybe what would hold your hand back is on the\\ninside. There wouldn’t be any outside.”  \\nMany of the students seemed to be struggling to move from questions\\nthat are difficult, if not impossible, to answer because of our\\n  limitations (e.g., not being certain that a\\nparticular grain of sand has not already been counted) to questions\\nthat   are unanswerable. Finally, with a\\nmischievous grin on his face, one of the students asked, “Will\\ntime end?” The problem, he explained, is that if time did end,\\nno one would be able later to confirm that this was so.  \\npractical  \\nin principle  \\nHere is another illustration of how quickly a discussion of logic can\\nmove to a discussion of deep philosophical issues (Pritchard, 1985).\\nThis is a group of 5  graders considering the sentence,\\n“All people are animals.” One of the students offered this\\nas another example of a true sentence that becomes false when\\nreversed. Jeff objected that “All people are animals” is\\nnot true. Chip proceeded to develop a taxonomy that relegated people,\\nalong with elephants and tigers, under the heading of mammals, mammals\\nunder animals, and animals under living things. Jeff continued to\\nobject.  \\nth  \\nChip: “Jeff, what are people? Just tell me, what are people? You\\ncan’t answer that, can you?”  \\nJeff: “Yes, I can.”  \\nChip: “What are you?”  \\nJeff: “A person.”  \\nChip: “What’s a person?”  \\nJeff: “A living somebody.”  \\nChip: “A living somebody could be a whale.”  \\nJeff: “I said,  , not an\\nanimal….”  \\nsomebody  \\nChip: “You can check every single book out there in the\\nlibrary—well, every one that’s about\\nus….”  \\nLarry: “I want to know why everyone’s getting so huffy\\nabout a little subject.”  \\nRich: “We’re  ! That’s what\\nwe’re here for.”  \\nthinking  \\nAmy: “Does anyone have an encyclopedia in here so we can look up\\neither animals, mammals, or persons?”  \\nJeff: “We’re all humans. So, if this Mars guy saw us, he\\nwould say, ‘Hey, look, there’s some human beings.’\\nHe wouldn’t say, ‘Hey, look, there’s some animals\\ndown there.’”  \\nMike: “Martians, if there are any, would say, ‘Hey, look\\nat those weird looking creatures,’ or something like that. They\\nwouldn’t know   we are. They don’t know\\nanything about us.”  \\nwhat  \\nChip: “There’s living life, okay? Then you branch off from\\nthere. You have animals, plants, and whatever the other stuff\\nis—you know, molecules and things like that. Now you go to the\\nanimals and you branch off—mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and\\nwhatever there is. Then you branch off and you have all these special\\nhumans. Is that right so far, Jeff?”  \\nJeff: “Just go on.”  \\nChip: “Well, I just want to know if you agree so far.”  \\nJeff: “Just go on. Go on. I’m not going to change my mind.\\nThat’s all…. I’m not an animal. I’m a person,\\nand I’m going to stay that way.”  \\nAmy: “People are a type of animal, like a bird is. That’s\\ndifferent than like an elephant is. A bird’s different than an\\nelephant. And we’re different than a bird.”  \\nThe discussion continued for several more minutes. As the group\\ndispersed, one student remarked to another, “If we want to, we\\ncould argue for hours!” “For days,” replied the\\nsecond. Meeting weekly after school in the local public library, this\\ngroup of children returned the next week with an encyclopedia to try\\nto settle the matter. After several minutes of discussion, the teacher\\nasked the students if they thought everything in the encyclopedia is\\ntrue.  \\nEmily: “Some things we’re not sure of; and the\\nencyclopedia could put down every word about how the solar system was\\nformed, and it would probably say there was big dust that spun around\\nlike a top. But we’re not sure about that. And, so, that could\\nbe wrong.”  \\nThe teacher asked whether, in such cases, the encyclopedia would say,\\n“We’re not sure.”  \\nMike: “It’ll say ‘hypothesis’—which is a\\nguess.”  \\nKurt: “It’ll say we’re not sure yet.”  \\nSo, the discussion retained its philosophical vitality. This\\nparticular group continued to meet weekly for the entire school year,\\ndiscussing a wide range of philosophical topics, including: the\\nrelationship between the mind and the brain, differences (and\\nsimilarities) between dreams and reality, knowledge of other minds,\\nself-knowledge, and relationships between evidence and knowledge.  \\n2. Philosophy in a Crowded Curriculum  \\nThose favoring adding philosophy to K-12 school programs face the\\nchallenges of an already crowded curriculum and growing pressure to\\nprovide quantifiable evidence of student mastery of the standard\\nsubjects of history, literature, math, and science. Where is time to\\nbe found for the give-and-take of philosophical discussions? Adding\\nphilosophy to the mix, doubters object, only makes matters worse. Not\\nonly is it yet another subject, it is one that many teachers may find\\nunsettling. They may fear that philosophy’s continual\\nquestioning will actually interfere with students’ mastery of\\nthe subjects already in the curriculum. Given the unsettling nature of\\nmuch philosophical inquiry, they may feel vulnerable as teachers\\nbecause they are not confident of their own answers to the questions\\nposed.  \\nAdding to this problem is increasing pressure on teachers to\\ndemonstrate that their students are performing at satisfactory levels\\nin already established subjects. Standardized tests are commonly used\\nas the measure of student achievement. Marked by definitive,\\nunambiguous questions and answers, these tests do not place a premium\\non philosophical reflection. Since student performance is typically\\nlinked to school funding, this is not something teachers can take\\nlightly, however skeptical some of them might be about the educational\\nvalue of preparing their students to perform well on standardized\\ntests.  \\nIn response, advocates of bringing philosophy into the schools such as\\nMatthew Lipman and his colleague Ann Margaret Sharp have countered\\nthat the introduction of philosophy can enhance the entire educational\\nexperience of students. They urge that the aim is more than simply the\\nintroduction of one more subject in the schools. Philosophy, they\\ninsist, invites students to reflect on relationships among different\\nareas of inquiry and to make sense of their educational experiences as\\na whole. This can add to the meaningfulness of students’\\neducation as a whole. In addition, philosophy can make important\\ncontributions to another area of concern that cuts across the\\ncurriculum, critical thinking.  \\nIn the mid-1960s, Matthew Lipman became dismayed at the low quality of\\nargumentation employed by presumably well-educated citizens discussing\\nthe Vietnam war and society’s ills in general. Convinced that\\nthe teaching of logic should begin long before college, he tried to\\nfigure out a way to do this that would stimulate the interest of\\n10–11 year olds. Leaving his secure position of teaching\\nphilosophy at Columbia University for an open ended one at Montclair\\nState College, he undertook work on his first children’s novel,\\n . Lipman’s concerns\\nabout the level of critical thinking in society in general, and the\\nschools in particular, were not his alone. By the 1970s the hue and\\ncry for teaching critical thinking in the schools was, if not clear,\\nat least loud; and it has continued largely unabated to the\\npresent.  \\nHarry Stottlemeier’s Discovery  \\nWhat is meant by ‘critical thinking’? Characterizations\\nrange in complexity from Robert Ennis’s admirably brief,\\n“reasonable reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what\\nto believe or do” (Ennis 1987) to a complex statement by a group\\nof 46 panelists convened by the American Philosophical\\nAssociation’s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy to employ the\\nDelphi Method of striving for consensus:  \\nWe understand critical thinking to be purposeful, self-regulatory\\njudgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and\\ninference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual,\\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon\\nwhich that judgment is based…. The ideal critical thinking is\\nhabitually inquisitive, well-informed, trustful of reason,\\nopen-minded, flexible, fair-minded in evaluation, honest in facing\\npersonal biases, prudent in making judgments, willing to reconsider,\\nclear about issues, orderly in complex matters, diligent in seeking\\nrelevant information, reasonable in the selection of criteria, focused\\nin inquiry, and persistent in seeking results which are as precise as\\nthe subject and the circumstances of inquiry permit. (Facione, 1989)  \\nLipman was a member of this panel, and it is clear that his novels and\\nteacher’s manuals all strive to meet these objectives. His\\nbriefer depiction of critical thinking is that it involves judgments\\nbased on criteria, or reasons. Criteria, he says, can be appraised in\\nterms of “megacriteria” such as reliability, relevance,\\nstrength, coherence, and consistency (Lipman 1991, p. 119). Critical\\nthinking, he adds, is characterized as “thinking that (1)\\nfacilitates judgment because it (2) relies on criteria, (3) is\\nself-correcting, and (4) is sensitive to context.” (Lipman 1991,\\np. 116)  \\nPicking up on the idea that critical thinking is sensitive to context,\\nsome critics challenge the notion that critical thinking can be\\nusefully taught independently of specific disciplinary areas (McPeck,\\n1985). While conceding that there are some generic features of\\ncritical thinking that cut across disciplines, they maintain that even\\nthese features acquire their meanings only in specific contexts that\\nvary across disciplines (such as history, sociology, biology,\\nchemistry). However, unless the different disciplines ask questions\\nabout their own basic assumptions and their relationships to one\\nanother, critical thinking within those disciplines will overlook\\nimportant questions that need attention. Philosophy does ask such\\nquestions about the different disciplines, including itself.  \\nLipman’s hope was that philosophy would acquire a central place\\nin the K-12 curriculum, thus enabling students to develop their\\ncritical thinking skills through philosophical questioning. At the\\nsame time, he claimed, philosophy can help students make better sense\\nof their educational experiences. By seeking to develop comprehensive\\nperspectives, philosophy attempts to understand connections. A\\ncurriculum that divides students’ education into discrete,\\nself-contained disciplines without encouraging philosophical questions\\nabout the nature of those disciplines and their relationships to one\\nanother invites a fragmented view of education. Lipman’s\\nproposed alternative is described in the next section, which describes\\nthe K-12 program developed by the Institute for the Advancement of\\nPhilosophy for Children (IAPC) that he and Ann Margaret Sharp\\nfounded.  \\nShort of the ambitious program Lipman and his IAPC colleagues had in\\nmind for the schools, there are more modest, but worthwhile, ways of\\nbringing philosophical inquiry into the already existing disciplinary\\nstructure in the schools. Teachers can invite their students to\\nreflect on philosophical aspects of their subjects of study. At the\\nsame time they study history, students can take some time to ask\\nquestions about the extent to which historical accounts can be\\nobjective—and questions about what ‘objectivity’\\nmight mean, and why it is or is not important to seek it. Similar\\nquestions can be asked about the natural and social sciences,\\nincluding questions about the extent to which science is, or ought to\\nbe, “value-free”. In fact, if room for such questions is\\nnot encouraged, one might well ask to what extent critical thinking\\nitself is encouraged.  \\nFinally, especially since the passing of Lipman and Sharp in 2010 and\\n2011, many of those originally inspired by their work have initiated\\nefforts to introduce groups of children to philosophy outside the\\nformal educational setting of the schools.  \\n3. The Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)  \\nThe educational movement known as Philosophy for Children got its\\nstart in the early 1970s with the publication of Matthew\\nLipman’s philosophical novel for children,  . In 1970   made its\\nentry into the Montclair Public Schools in New Jersey. By the mid-70s\\nthe Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)\\nwas formally in place at Montclair State College (now Montclair State\\nUniversity). The media quickly picked up on reports of significant\\nimprovements in the reading and critical thinking skills of middle\\nschool children who were involved in IAPC programs. Subsequently, IAPC\\nproduced materials consisting of Lipman’s children’s\\nnovels and, under the leadership of IAPC colleague Ann Margaret Sharp,\\naccompanying teacher workbooks for the entire K-12 curriculum.\\nThousands of children in New Jersey, across the United States, and\\neven around the world have subsequently been introduced to IAPC\\neducational programs.  \\nHarry\\nStottlemeier’s Discovery  \\nHarry  \\nAn unassuming 96 page novel for middle-school children, Lipman’s\\nfirst novel,  , features\\nHarry and his 5  grade classmates. Adults occasionally\\nenter in, but the primary philosophical work is done by the children.\\nHarry and his friends discover several basic concepts and rules of\\nAristotelean logic; and they puzzle over questions about the nature of\\nthought, mind, causality, reality, knowledge and belief, right and\\nwrong, and fairness and unfairness.  \\nHarry Stottlemeier’s Discovery  \\nth  \\n“What   Harry Stottlemeier’s discovery?”\\n ’s readers might ask. This question is not\\ndirectly answered. However, one candidate stands out among the many\\nthings that Harry discovers in the course of exploring questions about\\nlogic, knowledge, reality, and the mind. Harry and his classmates are\\nasked to write a paper on the topic, “The Most Interesting Thing\\nin the World.” Entitled  , Harry’s essay\\nbegins:  \\nis  \\nHarry  \\nThinking  \\nTo me, the most interesting thing in the whole world is thinking. I\\nknow that lots of other things are also very important and wonderful,\\nlike electricity, and magnetism and gravitation. But although we\\nunderstand them, they can’t understand us. So thinking must be\\nsomething very special.  \\nAfter writing several more paragraphs, Harry puts his paper aside.\\nLater he thinks, “In school, we think about math, and we think\\nabout spelling, and we think about grammar. But who every heard of\\nthinking about thinking?” So, he adds one more sentence to his\\npaper: “If we think about electricity, we can understand it\\nbetter, but when we think about thinking, we seem to understand\\nourselves better.”  \\nWithout using the word ‘philosophy,’ either here or\\nanywhere else in  , Lipman shows Harry engaged in serious\\nphilosophical thought, “thinking about thinking.” This, we\\nmight say, reveals Harry’s discovery of the joys of\\nphilosophical thinking. But there is more. Harry also notices that, as\\ninteresting and important as thinking about thinking is, it seems to\\nhave no special place in school. Finally, although his paper begins in\\nthe first person, it quickly moves to ‘we’ and focuses on\\nwhat might be accomplished   in the classroom.  \\nHarry  \\nwith others  \\nOne of the more attractive features of the IAPC approach to Philosophy\\nfor Children for many teachers has been that it promotes the idea of\\nthe classroom as a “community of inquiry” in which\\nstudents openly and respectfully exchange ideas. Each student is\\nregarded as having the potential to make valuable contributions to the\\ntopics under consideration. Students are encouraged to develop good\\nlistening skills, responsiveness to what others say, willingness to\\ntry to support one’s own ideas with good reasons, and openness\\nto the possibility that one should modify one’s beliefs in light\\nof new considerations. In short, the classroom is designed to\\nreinforce the student’s potential for  .\\nThis involves more than being able to engage in skillful reasoning. As\\nLaurance J. Splitter and Ann Margaret Sharp put it (Splitter and\\nSharp, p. 6):  \\nreasonableness  \\nReasonableness is primarily a social disposition: the reasonable\\nperson respects others and is prepared to take into account their\\nviews and their feelings, to the extent of changing her own mind about\\nissues of significance, and consciously allowing her own perspective\\nto be changed by others. She is, in other words, willing to be\\nreasoned with.  \\nTeachers who look favorably on the idea that the classroom should be a\\n“community of inquiry” nevertheless may resist the idea\\nthat   should be the centerpiece for discussion.\\nOther subjects, they might contend, lend themselves well to forming\\nthe sort of collaborative learning environment that can fairly be\\ncalled a “community of inquiry.” Philosophy for Children\\nadvocates, however, need only insist that the sort of inquiry they are\\nsupporting be philosophical, rather than being simply shared.\\nUnfortunately, Ann Margaret Sharp passed away in 2011. The\\ndistinctiveness of the sort of inquiry she and Lipman advocated is\\nexplored in some detail in a recent collection of essays by and about\\nher that is dedicated to her memory,   (Gregory\\nand Laverty, 2017). [This is the first book in Routledge’s\\nPhilosophy for Children Founders series of volumes to be edited by\\nMaughn Rollins Gregory and Megan Jane Laverty. The second volume is\\n , 2022, with\\nseveral other books in this series forthcoming.]  \\nphilosophy  \\nIn Community of Inquiry with\\nAnn Margaret Sharp: Philosophy, Childhood and Education  \\nGareth Matthews, The Child’s Philosopher  \\nIt may be thought that philosophy is, at best, a suitable subject for\\nrelatively few students at the pre-college level. Since philosophy\\ntraditionally has been taught only at the college level in the United\\nStates, it might be thought that it can be suitable for only a small\\nsegment of students at pre-college levels—the two percent of\\nstudents who are classified as “gifted and talented.”\\nHowever, Philosophy for Children programs have shown themselves to be\\nremarkably successful in drawing virtually all students in the\\nclassroom together in inquiry. Teachers are often surprised, and\\npleased, to see many of their most reticent,\\n“underachieving” students actively join in the discussion\\nof philosophical ideas.  \\nNevertheless, because they lack background in the formal study of\\nphilosophy, many teachers are reluctant to encourage the philosophical\\nthinking of their students. Their fears, however, are exaggerated.\\nFamiliarity with some of the standard philosophical literature might\\nbe desirable, but it is not necessary for bringing Philosophy for\\nChildren into the classroom. What is required is the ability to\\nfacilitate philosophical discussion. For this, it is much more\\nimportant that teachers have some philosophical curiosity themselves\\nthan a familiarity with academic philosophical literature. Like their\\nstudents, teachers unfamiliar with the discipline of philosophy may\\nnevertheless have an aptitude for philosophical thinking—or at\\nleast a knack for recognizing when others are engaged in philosophical\\nthought.  \\nFacilitating a Philosophy for Children discussion does not mean\\ndominating it; it is important for teachers to allow their students to\\ndevelop their own ideas. Teachers are not expected to provide, or even\\nhave, answers to all the questions. They can share puzzlement with\\ntheir students, be open to unexpected but suggestive responses to the\\nquestions they and their students pose, and take pleasure in observing\\nthe exchanges students have with each other. This means shedding the\\ntraditional role of teacher as lecturer and answer-giver. Especially\\nfor teachers who are uncertain about what this entails, workshops like\\nthose offered by IAPC provide a good introduction to the pedagogy of\\nPhilosophy for Children. However, there is a growing number of\\norganizations around the world (some of which are mentioned below)\\nalso providing assistance for teachers.  \\n4. Philosophizing With Others?  \\nPhilosophy for Children encourages children to think  \\nthemselves at the same time that it encourages them to think\\n  others. However, philosophy is often viewed as more a\\nmatter of solitary reflection, perhaps involving exchanges between a\\nfew other solitary thinkers—something to which the\\n“masses” are neither privy nor attracted. Perhaps many\\nwould claim that this is philosophy at its best. Even if this were so\\n(a controversial view), it would not undermine arguments for including\\nphilosophy in the K-12 curricula. However esoteric physics and\\nmathematics at their best may be, the schools nevertheless recognize\\nthe importance of making these subjects available in some form to all\\nstudents. Similarly, Philosophy for Children advocates can counter\\nthat there should be a place for all students—whether labelled\\n“gifted and talented,” “underachieving,” or\\n“ordinary”—pursuing philosophical questions\\ntogether.  \\nfor  \\nwith  \\nFor this to work, it must be possible for children in the classroom to\\nengage in sustained philosophical discussion with others. As already\\nnoted, Gareth Matthew’s writings provide ample evidence that\\nchildren are capable of having interesting, if not profound,\\nphilosophical thoughts. Less obvious, however, is children’s\\nability to sustain and develop this with others. Anecdotes of young\\nchildren spontaneously sharing a philosophical thought with an\\nobservant adult are not sufficient. Matthews’   provides good evidence that children can go well beyond\\nthis. Other examples of substantial philosophical conversations of\\nchildren found in Lone (2012, 2021), McCall (2009), Pritchard (1996,\\n2022), Shapiro (2012), and Wartenberg (2009, 2013), among many others,\\nshould leave little doubt that children have this ability.  \\nDialogues With\\nChildren  \\n5. Philosophy For Children Today  \\nIn light of the rapidly expanding international interest in philosophy\\nfor children, the International Council for Philosophical Inquiry with\\nChildren (ICPIC) was established in 1985. ICPIC continues to sponsor\\nan international conference every other year, with hosts including\\nAustralia, Austria, Brazil, England, Mexico, Spain (twice), and\\nTaiwan.  \\nEven after the passing of IAPC pioneers Matthew Lipman (2010) and Ann\\nMargaret Sharp (2011), now led by Maughn Gregory and others, IAPC\\nretains a strong presence in ICPIC. However, many ICPIC members now\\nhave established their own institutional structures and have developed\\ncenters, associations, and programs. In North America, there is the\\nNorth American Association of Community of Inquiry (NAACI), which\\ngathers every other year (years when ICPIC is not meeting). With\\ninitial support from the American Philosophical Association’s\\nPre-College Philosophy Committee, PLATO (Philosophy Learning and\\nTeaching Organization) was formed. Now a non-profit organization\\nsupported by the Squire Family Foundation, PLATO sponsors annual\\nmeetings, and in 2022 the University of Washington Center for\\nPhilosophy for Children and PLATO were joined. PLATO also sponsors two\\nperiodicals:   and the online  . Australia and New Zealand are\\norganized under the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools\\nAssociations (FAPSA), which meets annually and publishes   as its official journal (Burgh and\\nThornton, 2016). In 1992 the Society for the Advancement of\\nPhilosophical Enquiry and Reflection in Education (SAPERE) was\\nestablished in Oxford, England. In 2007 England’s Philosophy\\nFoundation was established (Worley, 2011). Since 2005, the journal\\n  has been sponsored by ICPIC and the\\ngraduate program in education at the State University of Rio De\\nJaneiro (UERJ). These organizations, along with many other centers and\\nexperienced practitioners around the world, continue to support\\ntraining programs for teachers that enable them to introduce thousands\\nof children to philosophy, both inside and outside regular classrooms.  \\nQuestions  \\nPrecollege\\nPhilosophy and Public Practice  \\nJournal\\nfor Philosophy in Schools  \\nPhilosophy and Childhood  \\nAlthough there is continued use of IAPC materials, recent years have\\nbeen marked by a proliferation of alternative teaching resources and\\nways of engaging children in philosophical discussions. For years\\nGareth Matthews contributed reviews of children’s stories to\\n , then IAPC’s official journal (even though\\nIAPC’s own teaching materials made no use of other\\nchildren’s literature). This inspired Tom Wartenberg (2009,\\n2013) to develop his highly successful pre-college philosophy program\\nat Mt. Holyoke College (MA), a prize winning program that is built\\naround classic children’s stories. His website offers a wealth\\nof materials on children’s literature that are designed to\\nprovide guidance for those wishing to pursue philosophy with children.\\nKaren Murris was an early objector to Lipman’s resistance to\\nusing illustrated materials (Morris, 1992). She and Johana Haynes\\noffer a detailed account of the philosophical importance of picture\\nbooks (Murris and Haynes, 2012 and Murris, 2016). Peter Worley, head\\nof England’s Philosophy Foundation has written several\\nstimulating books for teachers and students that make no use of IAPC\\nmaterials. Australia’s Phil Cam has assembled a variety of\\nstories suitable for philosophical use with children. In short, there\\nis a rapidly growing list of resources that show great promise for\\nengaging children in philosophical discussions. (See, for example,\\nDeHaan et al. 1995; Fisher 1998; Keen 1997; Lewis and Chandley 2012;\\nLone 2012 & 2021; McCall 2009; Murris 1992, 2016; Sprod 2001, and\\nWhite 2000).  , a\\nperiodical sponsored by the American Philosophical Association’s\\nPre-College Philosophy Committee, features young people’s\\nwritings on special philosophical topics. The first issue (Spring\\n2001) focused on children’s rights.  \\nThinking  \\nQuestions: Philosophy for Young People  \\nFortunately, the internet makes it possible to keep up reasonably well\\nwith the latest developments around the world and communicate quickly\\nwith other educators interested in Philosophy for Children.\\nUnfortunately, many of these websites seem to be short-lived. However,\\nsee the Internet Resources section below for a list of websites that\\nare reliable and which provide links to other useful sites.  \\nBibliography  \\nBooks and Articles  \\nAstington, Janet Wilde, 1993,   Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.  \\nThe Child’s Discovery of\\nthe Mind  \\nBurgh, Gilbert and Simone Thornton, 2016, “Philosophy Goes\\nto School in Australia: A History 1982–2016,”  , 3(1): 59–83.  \\nJournal\\nof Philosophy in Schools  \\nBurgh, Gilbert and Simone Thornton (eds.), 2019,  , New York: Routledge.  \\nPhilosophical\\nInquiry With Children: The Development of an Inquiring Society in\\nAustralia  \\nCam, Philip, 1995,  , Sydney: Primary English Teaching Association\\nand Hale & Iremonger.  \\nThinking Together: Philosophical Inquiry\\nfor the Classroom  \\n–––, 1993 (1994, 1997),  , Sydney: Hare &\\nIremonger.  \\nThinking Stories 1,\\n2, and 3: Philosophical Inquiry for Children  \\n–––, 2006,  ,\\nCamberwell, Vic.: Australian Council for Educational Research.  \\n20 Thinking Tools  \\n–––, 2012,  ,\\nCamberwell, Vic.: Australian Council for Educational Research.  \\nTeaching Ethics in Schools  \\nCostello, Patrick J.M., 2000,  , London: David Fulton Publishers.  \\nThinking Skills and Early\\nChildhood Education  \\nCostello, Peter R.
